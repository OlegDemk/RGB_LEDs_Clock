# STM32F103_FreeRTOS_RGB_LEDs_Clock

HARDWARE:
Parts:
1. STM32F103C8t.
2. WS2812b. LEDs 96 LEDs/m. 
3. RTC3231.
4. SN74LVC1T45. Single-Bit Dual-Supply Bus Transceiver (Convert from 3.3V to 5V).
5. Breadboard.
6. Buttons. (4)
7. TFMT6000. Analog light sensor.
8. Power suplay, AC/DC 220 to 5V 1.5 - 2 A.
9. Wire and plug 220.

Clock was created based on STB32f103C8t microcontroller. Screen was created from WS2812b LES strip. The screen have pixwl size: 5x17 LEDs. All parts of Clock was printet on 3D printer using CoPET plastic except aluminium back screen pad. PLA plastic doesnt have enough temperature resistive and can change shape. 3D models was created in online program SketchUp. All 3d Models in 3D folder.
